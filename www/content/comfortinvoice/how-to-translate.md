# How to Translate

We are not providing any translation (if we add we will mention in future) with the plugin, but we provide the translation template or pot file inside this pluginâ€™s languages folder which can be translated using standard wordpress translation process. But we recommend using [Loco translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) which helps to translate from the WordPress dashboard and very easy. We have a video tutorial about [how to use this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOkEzvjx6PM) loco translate plugin.
