# Agency Manager

The Agency Manager serves as the foundational component of the Comfort Accounting system, acting as the **entry point** for all operations and integrations within the platform. It ensures that every action and component is systematically organized and associated with specific agencies, providing a streamlined approach to accounting management.

## Key Features ##

**Agency Management**:
+ **Create, edit, and delete** agency information effortlessly.
+ Manage core details of agencies to maintain organized workflows.

**Member Management**:
+ Each agency holds its own set of members with assigned **roles and permissions**.
+ Permissions are managed on an **agency basis**, ensuring secure and customized access.
+ Members can be invited via **email**, with the flexibility to **accept or reject** invitations.

**Frontend Integration (Pro)**:
+ All features are seamlessly managed through frontend interfaces, respecting **agency-specific permissions**.
+ The frontend experience empowers users to interact with their assigned agencies efficiently.

**Permission-Based Access Control (Frontend Pro)**:
+ Agency-level permissions ensure granular control over what members can **view, edit, or manage** within the frontend system.
+ Seamless integration of permission-based management extends to all related components.

**Export Options (Reports Pro)**:
+ Listing Export allows all agency details in bulk with supported formats, including **XLS, XLSX, ODS, and PDF**.
+ Single Export allow individual agency details in **JSON or PDF** format.

Both features are accessible exclusively with the Reports Pro Addon, offering enhanced reporting and data export capabilities.

By consolidating actions, permissions, and member management within the Agency Manager, this component lays the groundwork for a robust and scalable accounting solution.
