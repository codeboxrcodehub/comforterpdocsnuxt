# Category Manager

The Category Manager is designed to streamline the management of financial categories within the system, enabling clear organization and classification of transactions.

## Key Features ##

**Category Types**:

**Category Management**:
+ Users can easily **create, update, and manage categories** to suit their operational requirements.
+ The intuitive interface ensures hassle-free navigation and control over category data.

**Category Color**:
+ Each category can be assigned a unique color, making it **visually distinguishable** and **easy to identify**.
